# AI-project--Inferring-Characteristic-Traits-of-An-author-given-his-or-her-work
1.This   project   presents   a   method   to   predict   the   characteristic   traits   of   an   author   of   a   given   book.  
Characteristic   traits   -   like   gender,   race,   age   of   the   author   at   the   time   of   publishing,   the   genre   
of   the   book,   and   other   socioeconomic   and   psychological   factors   -   which   influence   the   content   and   style   of 
 writing   of   an   author   can   be   predicted   given   his/her   work.   Multiple   feature   vectors(tf-idf,   n-gram,   
POS   tagging)   were   extracted   from   texts   using   preprocessing   techniques   (stopword   removal,   stemming,   lemmatization) 
  and   a   comparative   performance   study   for   every   technique   was   analyzed   by   applying   six   classi cation   methods 
  (namely   Naïve   Bayes,   SVM   using   gradient   descent,   k-NN,   Random   Forest,   Passive   Aggressive,   Perceptron).   These 
  analytic   studies   were   performed   with   the   aid   of   the   sklearn   machine   learning   library   and   the   Natural   
Language   Toolkit.   The   performance   of   the   classifiers   was   further   compared   for   data   with   and   without 
preprocessing. This project focuses on predicting two traits- the gender and age of the author.

2.The code author_profiling_pan_data.py performs author profiling on the PAN 2013 DATASET.

3. The code author_profiling_books.py performs author profiling for a dataset of ebooks.

4. The paper Inferring Characteristic Traits of an Author using Text Analytics _final.pdf describes the project in detail.
